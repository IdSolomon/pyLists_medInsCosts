# âš• Hi

Continuing my medical insurance journey, part 5, I'll be playing the role of a 
doctor-data scientist sorting through medical insurance cost data for some patients.

Using my knowledge of Python lists, I will store medical data and see what valuable 
insights I can gain from said data.
